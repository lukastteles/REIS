#					correspond to exactly one code. This attribute serves as a key for 
#					all entries in the repository.

#					This attribute is used for all entries in the repository.

#					certain category.  This attribute is used only for exception and validation entries. 

#severity 	 	The severity of the exception. Values can be: INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, FATAL. 
#					If this attribute is blank, it will default to ERROR.  This attribute is used 
#					only for exception entries.
